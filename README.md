OpenGL introductory code plus 2D game based on flappy bird

## About

This repository is composed of simple OpenGL programs, it uses premake5 to build the projects.

The code inside `opengl` are simple opengl programs that uses: textures, transformations, instancing, etc.

The code inside `game` is a simple 2D game(with badly configured sprites) that is a copy of flappy bird that i called Flappy Space Ship
(because the player controls a spaceship)
